# Project Title

The scope of this project encompasses the utilization of a specific IP address range, specifically ranging from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.10. This allocation of IP addresses within the mentioned range is integral to the operational framework and network configuration established within the project's parameters. The usage of these addresses aligns with the design and implementation strategies adopted for the networking infrastructure, serving as identifiers within the local network environment. This delineated range is carefully managed and employed to facilitate seamless communication and connectivity among devices and systems constituting the network architecture.
