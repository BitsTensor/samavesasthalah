Project Title: VLAN and DHCP Server Integration for Enhanced Network Management

Introduction:
This project aims to enhance network management and efficiency through the integration of Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) and a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. By combining these technologies, the network infrastructure can be organized, segmented, and dynamically allocate IP addresses to devices, providing a more scalable and flexible environment.

Objectives:

VLAN Implementation:

Create and configure VLANs to logically segment the network based on departments, functions, or security requirements.
Implement VLAN tagging and trunking to allow the efficient flow of traffic between different VLANs.
DHCP Server Deployment:

Set up a centralized DHCP server to automate the assignment of IP addresses to devices on the network.
Configure DHCP scopes for each VLAN, ensuring proper IP address allocation within segmented network areas.
Benefits:

Improved Network Security:

VLANs enable the isolation of network segments, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and enhancing overall network security.
Enhanced Network Scalability:

VLANs allow for the easy expansion or modification of the network without major infrastructure changes, providing scalability as the organization grows.
Simplified Network Management:

Centralized DHCP management streamlines the process of IP address allocation, reducing the administrative overhead associated with manual IP address assignments.
Efficient Resource Utilization:

DHCP dynamically manages IP addresses, preventing conflicts and ensuring optimal use of available address space.
