I have successfully completed a project centered on corporate networking, integrating advanced routing, switching, and security protocols.
The project includes foundational configurations such as Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) implementation, inter-VLAN communication, as well as the setup of Dynamic and Static Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT).
This project is centered around network infrastructure, specifically focusing on advanced aspects such as routing, switching, and security configurations
