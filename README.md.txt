# Project Title

CORPORATE NETWORK WITH ADVANCE ROUTING, SWITCHING AND SECURITY
This network project aims to design and implement an efficient and scalable corporate network using the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) for dynamic routing. Additionally, the project includes the implementation of Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT) for improved security and efficient use of IP addresses.

## Installation
- Configure EIGRP on all routers and switches, ensuring proper summarization and filtering based on network requirements.

Implement NAT on the edge routers to facilitate the translation of private IP addresses to public IP addresses.

Configure PAT to allow multiple internal hosts to share a single public IP address.

Implement ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic, enhancing network security.

Set up monitoring tools to capture and analyze network performance, including EIGRP metrics and NAT/PAT translations.

Establish logging mechanisms to record important events and security-related activities.

## Usage
-This network project integrates EIGRP for dynamic routing, NAT for IP address conservation, and PAT for efficient use of public IP addresses. The implementation of security measures enhances the overall robustness of the corporate network, ensuring a secure and scalable environment for business operations. Regular monitoring and testing will be crucial for maintaining optimal network performance and identifying potential issues proactively.

Conduct thorough testing to ensure the successful implementation of EIGRP, NAT, and PAT. Validate the network's routing behavior, address translations, and security measures. Perform scalability testing to ensure that the network can handle expected growth in terms of devices and traffic.
